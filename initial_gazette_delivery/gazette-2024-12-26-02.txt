The Gazette was established on 2024-12-23 to improve transparency on important moderation matters, such as new rules enactments, public consultations, and rules violation judgments. For this purpose, we are starting the Gazette Delivery Service. If you want to receive the latest moderation news, you can subscribe to the Gazette Delivery Service.

The Gazette will be sent to the in-game email address @moderation:gazette_delivery. If you want to receive the Gazette in-game, please reply to this email. Moderators had been automatically included.

This issue of the Gazette is sent to everyone. Starting from the next issue, the Gazette will only be sent to subscribed players.
